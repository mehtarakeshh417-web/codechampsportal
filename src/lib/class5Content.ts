Change score when events happen\n\n**Complete scoring example:**\n```\nWhen green flag clicked\nset [score] to (0)\nset [lives] to (3)\n\n-- On the coin sprite:\nWhen green flag clicked\nForever\n  go to (random position)\n  wait until <touching [player]?>\n  change [score] by (10)\n  play sound 'pop'\n  go to (random position)\nEnd\n```\n\n**Difficulty increase:**\n```\nIf <(score) > (50)> then\n  set [speed] to (8)\nEnd\nIf <(score) > (100)> then\n  set [speed] to (12)\nEnd\n```\nThis makes the game harder as the score increases!",
